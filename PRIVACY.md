# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 15, 2026**

Metheus Extension ("Extension") is designed to help you learn languages. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your data.

## 1. Data Collection

We do **NOT** collect:

- Your browsing history.
- Personal information (name, address, etc.) unless provided to Metheus.
- Payment information.

We **DO** collect (locally on your device):

- Subtitle text from the videos you watch (stored temporarily for interaction).
- Text parsed from the DOM of webpages you visit, purely to enable the "Hover Dictionary" and "Web Colorizer" features (processed strictly locally).
- Screenshots and audio clips you explicitly record.
- Vocabulary learning status (Unknown/Known) stored in your local database.

## 2. Data Transmission

The Extension only transmits data to the internet in the following cases:

- **Sync**: If you enable synchronization, your vocabulary and cards are encrypted and sent to Metheus servers (`api.metheus.app`).
- **Telemetry**: We do not collect usage telemetry.

## 3. Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: Most data (settings, current subtitles) is stored in `chrome.storage.local` and IndexedDB on your device.
- **Cloud Storage**: Synced data is stored securely in Metheus's cloud (Firestore/Backblaze B2).

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Extension interacts with video streaming sites (Netflix, YouTube, etc.) to extract subtitles. We comply with their Terms of Service and do not bypass DRM protection.

## 5. Contact
